    "description": "Key concepts explained simply: Web 2 / Web 3, wallets, addresses and TXID.",
    "q1": "What is Web 2?",
    "a1": "It's the current web dominated by centralized platforms (apps, social networks, company servers) where you trust an intermediary.",
    "q2": "What is Web 3?",
    "a2": "An evolution that adds blockchain to verify and record actions/assets without relying on a third party. It provides ownership, traceability and public proof.",
    "q3": "Why do we still use Web 2 if Web 3 exists?",
    "a3": "Because there are cases where centralized is simpler or faster to use, and in others the public verification of Web 3 is key. We combine both as appropriate.",
    "q4": "What is a wallet?",
    "a4": "Your crypto wallet. It manages keys and signatures to prove that an action belongs to you. Think of it as your identity/keychain on the blockchain.",
    "q5": "What is a wallet address?",
    "a5": "It's like your account number. It's used to receive or locate your operations on the network. It doesn't reveal your private keys.",
    "q6": "Do I need to create my wallet to use the system?",
    "a6": "No. You register normally and we internally associate a wallet. You can use basic functions without installing anything. Then, if you want, you connect your personal wallet.",
    "q7": "Why do we use the Stacks blockchain?",
    "a7": "Because it's economical, stable and integrates with Bitcoin. It allows us to anchor data reliably for certificates and public verification.",
    "q8": "What is a transaction ID (TXID)?",
    "a8": "It's the unique identifier of an operation on the blockchain. With it you can check status, block and details to confirm authenticity.",
    "q9": "Is verification public?",
    "a9": "Yes. Anyone can check the TXID in a block explorer and confirm that the certificate exists and was issued correctly.",
    "q10": "What happens if the contract doesn't match the expected one?",
    "a10": "It indicates that the transaction does not belong to the certificate contract, avoiding false positives.",
    "q11": "Why are we decentralized?",
    "a11": "So that verification doesn't depend only on us: the evidence lives on the chain. Still, we offer a simple Web 2 style UX."
